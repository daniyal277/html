    <h3>History of Samsung</h3>
    <p>Samsung entered the mobile market in the late 1990s, but its breakthrough came with the Galaxy S series in 2010, running Android. Early models like the Galaxy S2 (2011) and S3 (2012) gained global popularity with improved performance and displays. The Galaxy Note series (2011) introduced large-screen "phablets" and the S Pen. The Galaxy S6 (2015) brought a premium glass-and-metal design, while the S8 (2017) introduced the Infinity Display with minimal bezels. The Galaxy Fold (2019) pioneered foldable smartphones, followed by the Galaxy Z Flip series. The S20 (2020) introduced high refresh rate displays, while the S21 and S22 refined cameras and performance. The S23 Ultra (2023) featured a 200MP camera, and Samsung continues leading innovation in foldables and AI-driven features, competing closely with Apple in the smartphone industry.</p>
        <h3>Production of samsung </h3>
        <p>Samsung's manufacturing process is highly advanced and globally integrated. It starts with extensive research and development (R&D) to design innovative products, followed by sourcing high-quality raw materials such as semiconductors, displays, and batteries from Samsung’s own divisions and external suppliers. Semiconductor manufacturing involves photolithography, deposition, and etching to create advanced processors and memory chips.
             In assembly plants across South Korea, Vietnam, India, and other countries, components are integrated, software is installed, and rigorous quality tests ensure durability, performance, and safety. After passing these checks, products are packaged and distributed worldwide through Samsung’s logistics network, ensuring efficient delivery to customers.
