    <h2>Motorola</h2> 
    <h3>History of Motorola </h3>
    <p>Motorola was founded in 1928 in the U.S. as a radio and communications company. 
        It gained fame for innovations like the first mobile phone, launched in 1983. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Motorola was a major player in the mobile industry, with iconic models like the Razr. However, competition from Apple and Samsung led to a decline. In 2011, Google acquired Motorola but later sold it to Lenovo in 2014. Under Lenovo, Motorola revived the Razr as a foldable phone and focused on budget and mid-range smartphones. Today, it continues to innovate while maintaining its legacy in mobile technology.</p>
    <h3>Production of Motorola</h3>
    <p>Motorola's production process focuses on efficiency and quality. It sources components like processors, displays, and batteries from major suppliers such as Qualcomm and MediaTek. Assembly takes place in factories across China, India, and Brazil, ensuring faster manufacturing and regional distribution. Motorola follows strict quality control measures, including durability, performance, and safety testing. Once assembled, devices are packaged and shipped through a global logistics network. Under Lenovo’s management, Motorola has optimized production to deliver reliable smartphones across budget, mid-range, and premium segments while maintaining its reputation for durability and innovation.</p>
